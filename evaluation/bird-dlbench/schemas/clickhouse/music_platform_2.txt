I think a lot of the negative feedback so far (itâs not what I thought, etc) is probably for that reason. It isnât what I expected either, but thatâs ok...Iâm still listening.  There are a lot of news recap shows already, so this is a great departure from that.', 4, '98BEC69B8D1E989', '2018-03-08T04:50:52-07:00', 193), ('fb4082f52df550a80cb35747c85a7845', 'Enterprise', 'Since I have been missing Star Trek alot lately, I have been rewatching all the series.

You guys did a very exquisite job creating the classic cartoons podcast.\n    Today, this afternoon, I would like to make a small request. In light of the protests going on our world right now, why donât you do your next episode about the Iconic Disney Strike of 1941. The reason why you could do that episode is, because, itâs so fresh in my mind about a certain period of unrest that still rings true to not only me, but to all of us Art, animation, and cartoon fans & practitioners to this day.\n     Didnât mean to geek out, but I completely mean it in a very sincere way. We hope you have the time, money, and effort to get that episode right, done, and out.

Of course some are my favorites and when I found this one, I listened to quite a few episodes. After the first couple I realized my mood was way different towards Disney as opposed to the other podcasts I listen to. This podcast made me feel really sad and not excited for the parks. I havenât been able to go to DW for almost 10 years because of the cost to go, but have been eagerly planning a trip hopefully in the next couple of years. When I listen to other shows it amps me up to write down restaurants and shows, but when I come here it makes me almost NOT want to go. TBH it seems like none of you even like the parks and are all so negative about it, obviously it is VERY expensive to go to Disney, no one can argue that, but almost every episode is everyone being upset about the price or other changes in the parks. I mean you guys donât have to go or talk about it? And if you do say something negative back it up with something positive! Iâm not saying everything has to be super happy all the time, but do you all even like the parks? I donât think it helps that a lot of these shows consist of annual pass holders that live in Florida so they are more used to the parks. There are a lot of people who canât go often, like me. I live in Oregon so to go itâs even more of a commitment. So even though rides and restaurants are normal to you, Iâve never seen avatar, galaxies edge, toy story land etc. Iâd just be happy to be there and know that the cost Iâm paying is worth it AND if itâs not worth it, I wonât go. Anyway, Iâm not trying to completely bash it and I probably will keep trying because maybe its just recent episodes? But I just wish there was more excitement and love for Disney. Because many of your shows just make me sad and not excited to go. I can tell you are passionate but can you all be more positive?', 2, '4EB6D918253F669', '2021-08-30T00:51:35-07:00', 490), ('cd2470e1e6da8bb14017e5951d6475fc', 'Literally laughing out loud, by myself, on my walks to work', 'I started watching the bachelorette in 2020 because...you know...2020.

I wish I could recommend them to more of my friends. I recognize that it feels a bit hyped-up or gimmicky with the talk of âunlocking the âsecretsâ to financial independenceâ and all, but if you can get past that, thereâs value here for anyone that wants more choice, control, and flexibility in their lives. \n\nThe early shows felt a bit like âcoming homeâ to a place where I could put more of a framework around my existing mindset and values - and the early shows have given me inspiration and a level of confidence to begin seriously making some impactful changes and ultimately to lead to a better life. Just a few episodes helped me to realize a lot of my financial ignorance, but also helped motivate me because I could see that I had inadvertently stumbled into a semi-FI mindset already. With the actionable advice and ideas in the early shows, I feel like I have more agency in my life and can make changes for the better.

I listened to every history of Rome podcast, and many of the revolutions podcasts.  I bought his Lafayette audiobook.  So I am a Mike Duncan fan.\n\nThe episode about the execution of Tsar Nicholas and his family was wrong.  It was wrong from an historical perspective and it as wrong in terms of how humans should behave.\n\nFrom the historical perspective, Mike did not acknowledge that the Communistsâ basement execution of eleven people would forever brand the Communists as monsters.  This had historical consequences for the next century.  Mike ignores this.\n\nFrom the human perspective, Mike treats shooting little boys and girls as the fault of their parents.  What is this about, Mike?  My grandmother (an FDR Democrat) told her husband when she heard about it, âThey even killed the children!â  This was mega-bad press, to this day.  This was not the execution of the family of a Roman emperor â- it happened in the 20th Century!\n\nMike, I would ask you to think about what you are saying a bit more.  This is not Charles I, where we can tell jokes and be detached from a long-ago event.  You may not like Nicholas, or think he is a jerk, but he is a saint of the Russian Orthodox Church and revered by millions of people today.  What happened to his family and servants was horrible.  \n\nYour cavalier attitude makes me never want to listen to a Mike Duncan podcast again.  Please prove to me that I am wrong and the humane Mike Duncan appears again in future.\n\nPaul M', 1, 'E01EE05C0AD6512', '2022-01-18T18:15:01-07:00', 971), ('f1a7cabd6127108563a0e38ae044b88a', 'Great Show Butâ¦', 'I love the casual, informative nature of this show, but I have an unexplainable, visceral dislike for the music used throughout the podcast.
