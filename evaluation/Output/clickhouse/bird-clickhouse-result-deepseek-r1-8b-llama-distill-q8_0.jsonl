Let me look at the original query first. The SELECT statement is a bit complex. It's using SUBSTR functions multiple times and some INSTR (which I think is like the FIND function in other databases). \n\nThe table is called Method, and the column being selected from is NameTokenized with a specific value 'online median filter test median window filling'. So the WHERE clause filters the rows to only those where NameTokenized equals that string.\n\nNow, looking at the SELECT part: SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 1). That seems like it's extracting the part of the Name after the first occurrence of a dot. Then, they're taking another SUBSTR from that result, starting at position 1, and length INSTR(SUBSTR(...), '.'), which probably gets the substring before the next dot.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, I think there's no INSTR function. Oh right, ClickHouse uses different functions. Instead of INSTR, it's better to use the positions of a character in a string. So maybe using the index of '.' in Name to split the name into parts.\n\nBut how? Because in SQL, INSTR returns the position, so adding 1 gives us where the substring starts after that dot. Then taking SUBSTR from there would get everything after the first dot. \n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, I can use the function called 'contains' or maybe 'indexOf'. Or perhaps using split and take the part after the first '.'.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write a function to find the position of the first occurrence of '.' and then extract the substring after that. But since ClickHouse doesn't have INSTR, I need another way.\n\nSo, for the first SUBSTR, I can use the index of '.' in Name, add 1, and take from there until the next dot. So something like: let pos = index(Name, '.'); then if pos is not null, take substring starting at pos+1, up to the position of the next '.'.\n\nBut since this is a SQL query, I can't use variables or let statements. So I need to do it all in one function.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using split by '.', then take the part after the first element. But that might not work if there are multiple dots.\n\nWait, the original query seems to be extracting the substring after the first dot and before the next dot. So for example, if Name is 'online.median.filter.test', then it would extract 'median'.\n\nIn ClickHouse, I can use split(Name, '.') which returns an array. Then take the second element (since the first is 'online'), but only if there are at least two elements.\n\nBut what if there's no '.' in Name? Maybe that's unlikely based on the data, but I should handle it to avoid errors. So perhaps using a function that safely gets the second part or returns null if not present.\n\nWait, but the original query subtracts 1 from INSTR(... '.'), so maybe after taking the substring between dots, they're taking everything except the last dot? Or perhaps it's extracting the first part after the initial dot.\n\nI'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nOriginal SQL: \nSELECT SUBSTR(SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 1), 1, INSTR(SUBSTR(...), '.')) - 1) as Result\nFROM Method\nWHERE NameTokenized = 'online median filter test median window filling'\n\nSo the inner part is:\nSUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 1) \nThis gives everything after the first '.'.\n\nThen, from that result, take another SUBSTR starting at position 1 (so the first character), with length equal to the number of characters before the next '.'.\n\nWait, so if the substring after the first '.' is 'median.filter.test', then INSTR(SUBSTR(...), '.') would give the position of the first '.', which is 6. So the SUBSTR starts at 1 and has a length of 6, giving 'medi'.\n\nBut the original query subtracts 1 from that, so it becomes 'medi' -1? Wait no, in SQL, the subtraction is applied after extracting the substring.\n\nWait no, the subtraction is part of the function. So after taking the substring starting at 1 with length equal to the position of '.', which is 6 (since in 'median.filter.test', the first '.' is at position 6), so the substring would be from index 1 for 6 characters: 'medi'. Then subtracting 1 gives 'med'.\n\nHmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nIn any case, to translate this into ClickHouse, I need to replicate that logic without using INSTR functions. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Find the first occurrence of '.' in Name.\n2. Extract the substring after that point.\n3. In that substring, find the next occurrence of '.' (if any).\n4. Take the substring from position 1 up to but not including that next '.'.\n\nSo in ClickHouse, I can use functions like split and indexOf.\n\nWait, ClickHouse has an index function: index('string', 'char') which returns the position of the first occurrence of 'char' in 'string'.\n\nAlso, there's a function called substring or substr. So putting it together:\n\nFirst, get the index of '.' in Name: idx1 = index(Name, '.').\n\nIf idx1 is not null, then the substring starts at idx1 + 1.\n\nThen, from that substring, find the next '.' : idx2 = index(substring(idx1+1), '.').\n\nWait, no. Because after taking the substring starting at idx1+1, I need to find the first '.' in that substring, not the original Name.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to split the string into parts by '.' and take the second part if possible.\n\nSo let's try:\n\nsplit(Name, '.', 1000) would split the string into an array of strings separated by '.', up to 1000 elements.\n\nThen, if the array has at least two elements, we can take the second element as our desired substring. But then we need to handle cases where there are no '.' or more than one '.'.\n\nWait, but in the original query, they're taking from idx1+1, which is after the first '.', and up to the next '.'.\n\nSo for example, if Name is 'a.b.c.d', then idx1 is 1, substring starts at 2, then in that substring 'b.c.d', find the first '.' at position 1. So the substring from index 1 of length 1 would be 'b'.\n\nWait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The original query seems to extract the part after the first '.' and before the next '.', which is the second segment if you split on '.'.\n\nSo in ClickHouse, maybe:\n\ns = split(Name, '.', 1000)[2]\n\nBut wait, if Name has only one '.', then [1] would be empty or something. So I need to make sure that there are at least two parts.\n\nAlternatively, using the index function:\n\npos_first_dot = index(Name, '.')\n\nif pos_first_dot is not null and pos_first_dot < length(Name) -1 (to ensure there's more than one character after), then:\n\nsub_after_first = substring(Name, pos_first_dot + 1)\n\nthen find the next '.' in sub_after_first:\n\npos_next_dot = index(sub_after_first, '.')\n\nif pos_next_dot is not null:\n\nthen take substring from 1 to pos_next_dot -1.\n\nBut since we can't use if statements directly in SQL, perhaps using functions that return empty strings when conditions are not met.\n\nAlternatively, using the coalesce function.\n\nWait, but ClickHouse doesn't support IF statements in column-wise operations. So I need a way to handle cases where there's no '.' or only one '.'.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky.\n\nAnother approach: use the split function with limit 3, so that even if there are more than two dots, it only splits into three parts. Then take part [2], which would be everything after the first dot and before the second. If there's no second dot, then it will just be everything after the first.\n\nSo:\n\nparts = split(Name, '.', 3)\n\nresult = parts[2] || '0' (if needed?) \n\nBut in the original query, they are subtracting 1 from the length of the substring before the next '.'. So perhaps taking one character less than that.\n\nWait, no. The original code is:\n\nSUBSTR(SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') +1), 1, INSTR(SUBSTR(...), '.')) -1\n\nWhich translates to:\n\nTake substring starting at position (INSTR(Name, '.') +1). Then from that substring, take a length equal to the position of the next '.'.\n\nSo for example, if after first '.', the string is 'median.filter.test', then INSTR(...) would be 6 (position of '.' in 'median.filter.test'). So taking 1 character from position 0: but wait, no. Wait, in SQL, substring starting at 1 with length equal to that position.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of string lengths and indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the result is just extracting the first segment after the first dot.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck on how to translate this into ClickHouse without using INSTR.\n\nWait, another idea: since ClickHouse allows for regex, maybe using a regex to capture the part between the first and second '.'.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\nusing the function to match the pattern after the first '.' up to the next '.'.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's possible in the context of a SELECT statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use split with limit 3 and then take the third element.\n\nLet me try writing this step by step.\n\nFirst, split Name into parts using split(Name, '.', 3). This will give an array where:\n\n- The first element is everything before the first '.'.\n- The second element is everything between the first and second '.'.\n- The third element is everything after the second '.' (if any).\n\nThen, if there are at least two elements, we take the second element. If not, perhaps return null or an empty string.\n\nSo:\n\ns = split(Name, '.', 3)\n\nselected_part = s[2]\n\nBut in ClickHouse, array indices start from 1? Or is it zero-based?\n\nWait, no, in SQL, arrays are one-based when using functions like get_element, but in column-wise operations, they are treated as zero-based.\n\nHmm, actually, I'm not sure. Maybe better to use the index function for more control.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to write a helper function that extracts the desired substring.\n\nBut since the task is to translate the SQL statement directly, maybe I can find a way without creating functions.\n\nWait, another approach: The original query subtracts 1 from the length of the part after the first '.' up to the next '.'.\n\nSo if after the first '.', we have 'median.filter.test', then the length is 6 (since 'median' is 6 letters), and taking 1 character gives 'm' and then subtracting 1 would give 'm'? That doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to just extract the substring after the first '.' without worrying about the next '.' because the original query is doing that, but then also taking a portion of it.\n\nI think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to write the translated SQL step by step.\n\nThe original query:\n\nSELECT SUBSTR(SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 1), 1, INSTR(SUBSTR(...), '.')) -1) AS Result FROM Method WHERE NameTokenized = 'online median filter test median window filling'\n\nSo, first, find the position of the first '.' in Name: pos1 = INSTR(Name, '.')\n\nThen, substring starts at pos1 +1: substr1 = SUBSTR(Name, pos1+1)\n\nThen, find the position of '.' in substr1: pos2 = INSTR(substr1, '.')\n\nThen, take a substring from substr1 starting at 1 (position 0 if we start from 0?) with length pos2: substr2 = SUBSTR(substr1, 1, pos2)\n\nWait, but SQL string functions are typically 1-based. So in SQL, INSTR and SUBSTR are 1-based.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nName is 'online.median.filter.test'\n\npos1 = INSTR(Name, '.') = 6 (since 'online.' is 6 characters)\n\nsubstr1 = SUBSTR(Name, 7) = 'median.filter.test'\n\npos2 = INSTR(substr1, '.') = 6 ('median.')\n\nThen substr2 = SUBSTR(substr1, 1, 6) = 'median'\n\nThen, substr2 -1 would be 'median' minus one character? Wait no, the '-' is a string subtraction. But in SQL, you can't subtract integers from strings. So perhaps it's an error.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the original query. Let me look again:\n\nSELECT SUBSTR(SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 1), 1, INSTR(SUBSTR(...), '.')) -1) task FROM Method WHERE ...\n\nSo the structure is:\n\nSUBSTR( A , 1, B ) -1\n\nWhere A = SUBSTR(Name, pos1+1)\n\nB = INSTR(A, '.')\n\nSo A is everything after the first '.', which is 'median.filter.test'\n\nThen B is the position of the first '.' in A, which is 6 ('median.').\n\nThen, substr from A starting at 1 (so index 0) for length B (6), giving 'median'.\n\nThen subtracting 1 would give 'median' - '1'? That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract numbers from strings. Maybe it's a typo and should be CAST as integer?\n\nWait, perhaps the '-' is not subtraction but just part of the function name or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the query structure. Perhaps the entire expression is inside a function that returns an integer, so the '-' applies to integers.\n\nBut in any case, I think the main goal is to extract the substring between the first and second '.'.\n\nSo in ClickHouse, perhaps using split with limit 3:\n\nparts = split(Name, '.', 1000)\n\nif parts[2] exists, take it; else, take empty string or something.\n\nThen, in ClickHouse, since we can't use if statements, maybe using coalesce:\n\nresult = coalesce(parts[2], '') \n\nBut then, how to handle cases where there's only one '.'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the index function multiple times.\n\nSo, let me try writing it as:\n\npos_first_dot = index(Name, '.')\nif pos_first_dot is not null:\n    sub_after_first = substring(Name, pos_first_dot + 1)\n    pos_second_dot = index(sub_after_first, '.')\n    if pos_second_dot is not null:\n        result = substring(sub_after_first, 1, pos_second_dot - 1)\n    else:\n        result = sub_after_first\nelse:\n    result = ''\n\nBut since we can't use conditionals in SQL, perhaps using functions that return empty strings when certain conditions are met.\n\nAlternatively, in ClickHouse, perhaps:\n\ns = split(Name, '.', 3)[2] || coalesce(substring(Name, pos_first_dot +1, pos_second_dot -1), '')\n\nWait, but without knowing the positions, it's hard. Maybe better to write a helper function.\n\nBut since I can't define functions in the query, perhaps it's better to split with limit 3 and take part [2], and handle cases where there are not enough parts by padding with empty strings or similar.\n\nAlternatively, use the following approach:\n\ns = split(Name, '.', 1000)[2] || coalesce(split(substring(Name, index(Name, '.') +1), '.'[1]), '')\n\nWait, that might work. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, split Name into up to 1000 parts by '.', giving an array. Take the third element (index 3 if zero-based or 2 if one-based). But in ClickHouse, when you split with a limit, the number of elements is min(limit, number_of_delimiters +1).\n\nSo for example, 'a.b.c.d' split into 3 parts gives ['a', 'b', 'c.d'].\n\nWait no, actually, the third element would be 'c.d', which isn't correct. So maybe it's better to find a way to get only up to two splits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the index function multiple times.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck again. Maybe for the purpose of this task, since time is limited, I can proceed with:\n\ns = split(Name, '.', 3)[2]\n\nWhich would give 'b' in 'a.b', but wait no: 'a.b.c.d' split into 3 parts would be ['a', 'b', 'c.d'], so [2] is 'c.d'. But we want the part between first and second '.'.\n\nSo perhaps a better way is to use:\n\npos1 = index(Name, '.')\nif pos1 is not null:\n    sub_after_pos1 = substring(Name, pos1+1)\n    pos2 = index(sub_after_pos1, '.')\n    if pos2 is not null:\n        result = substring(sub_after_pos1, 0, pos2 -1)\n    else:\n        result = sub_after_pos1\nelse:\n    result = ''\n\nBut again, without conditionals, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the following approach:\n\nresult = substring(Name, index(Name, '.' ) +1 , coalesce(index(substring(Name, index(Name, '.' )+1 ), '.' ) -1, length(substring(Name, index(Name, '.' )+1 )) ))\n\nBut that seems complicated and may not work correctly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use regex to capture the part between the first two dots.\n\nIn ClickHouse, you can use regex functions. So:\n\nimport Regex = 'somePackage.Reg'\n\nresult = coalesce(Regex.sub('^(.*?\\\\.)(.*?)', Name)[2], '')\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact syntax. Maybe using a custom function isn't feasible here.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best way is to proceed with splitting into 3 parts and taking the second part, assuming that there are at least two '.' in Name. But in reality, this might not always work.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the original query subtracts 1 from the length of the substring up to the next '.', maybe it's better to just take one character less than the entire substring after the first '.'.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven all that, perhaps the translated SQL is:\n\nSELECT (CONCAT(SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 2), COALESCE(CONCAT(substring(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') +2, INSTR(substring(Name, INSTR(Name, '.')+1, '.'))), ''))) - 1) AS result FROM Method WHERE NameTokenized = 'online median filter test median window filling'\n\nBut that seems convoluted and probably incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression is supposed to extract a single character.\n\nWait, considering that the original query has:\n\nSUBSTR(A, 1, B) where B is the position of '.' in A. So if A is 'median.filter.test', B would be 6 ('median.' is 6 characters). Then SUBSTR(A, 1,6) would be 'edian'? Wait no, starting at index 0 (since it's 1-based?), but I'm getting confused.\n\nI think I need to find another approach. Maybe considering that the result of the original query is always a single character, perhaps the translated SQL should extract the first character after the first '.'.\n\nSo, for 'online.median.filter.test', it would be 'm'.\n\nIn that case, the translated SQL could be:\n\nSELECT SUBSTR(substring(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 2), 1, 1) AS result FROM Method WHERE NameTokenized = 'online median filter test median window filling'\n\nBecause:\n\nINSTR(Name, '.') gives the position of the first '.'.\n\nAdding 2 would start from the next character (since it's 1-based).\n\nTaking 1 character would be that character.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nName is 'online.median.filter.test'\n\npos = INSTR(Name, '.') = 6\n\nsub_start = pos +1 =7\n\nsub = SUBSTR(Name, 7) = 'median.filter.test'\n\nthen sub_start2 = sub_start (which is 7)\n\ntaking 1 character from position 0 would give 'm'.\n\nWait, but in SQL, substring functions are typically 1-based.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nSUBSTR(substring(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 2), 1) \n\nWhich gives the first character after the first '.'.\n\nThus, the translated SQL is:\n\nSELECT SUBSTR(SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') +2 ), 1) AS result FROM Method WHERE NameTokenized = 'online median filter test median window filling'\n\nThis would extract the first character after the first '.', which in this case is 'm'.\n\nThen, perhaps subtracting 1 as per the original query? But that doesn't make sense with strings. Maybe it's a mistake and they meant to return this character.\n\nAlternatively, if the '-' is a typo, then this would be the correct extraction.\n\nGiven all that, I think the best approach is to extract the first character after the first '.'.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the given SQL query into ClickHouse, we need to extract the substring starting right after the first dot ('.') and take only one character from there. This corresponds to the character immediately following the first dot in the `Name` column.\n\n**Translated Query:**\n\n```clickhouse\nSELECT \n    SUBSTR( \n        SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, '.') + 2), \n        1 \n    ) AS result \nFROM \n    Table \nWHERE \n    NameTokenized = 'online median filter test median window filling'\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Finding the first occurrence of '.' in `Name`:**\n   - Using `INSTR(Name, '.')` gives the position of the first dot.\n\n2. **Extracting the substring starting right after the first dot:**\n   - `SUBSTR(Name, INSTR(Name, ')' + 2)` starts from the character immediately following the dot.\n\n3. **Taking one character from this substring:**\n   - `SUBSTR(..., 1)` extracts just the first character of the resulting substring.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly capture the character following the first dot in the `Name` column, which is what the original query intended to achieve."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 86226278993, "load_duration": 58087538, "prompt_eval_count": 312, "prompt_eval_duration": 19247459, "eval_count": 4783, "eval_duration": 86145923321, "sql_id": 48}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original query is a SELECT with several parts. It starts with SELECT DISTINCT and uses a CAST function on a COUNT within a CASE. Then there's an OVER clause with a PARTITION BY T2.SEASON. The main part is multiplied by 100 divided by another COUNT over the same partition.\n\nI should identify each component:\n\n1. **SELECT DISTINCT**: I'll need to keep that as it ensures only unique values are returned.\n   \n2. **CAST(COUNT(...) AS REAL)**: In ClickHouse, I can use the CAST function similarly, but I think using an alias might be necessary if needed for type conversion.\n\n3. **CASE WHEN T1.nation = 'Sweden' THEN T1.ELITEID ELSE NULL**: This is a conditional COUNT. I'll replicate this structure in ClickHouse using the CASE() function inside COUNT.\n\n4. **OVER (PARTITION BY T2.SEASON)**: In ClickHouse, PARTITION BY is done using the PARTITION clause in the TABLE JOIN or subquery.\n\n5. The multiplication and division parts should be straightforward: (* 100 / COUNT(...)).\n\n6. The FROM clause joins PlayerInfo as T1 with SeasonStatus as T2 on ELITEID, which I'll replicate.\n\n7. The WHERE condition filters on SEASON values, so that's also the same in ClickHouse.\n\nNow, considering the data types and structures:\n\n- **ELITEID** is an integer in both schemas.\n- **SEASON** in SQLite is a string, but in ClickHouse it's still a String.\n- Functions like COUNT() are similar, but I should ensure that any aggregate functions used correctly partition as needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the structure would be:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT (COUNT(CASE() ... ) * 100 / COUNT()) FROM ...\n\nI need to make sure that the CASE expression is correctly placed within the COUNT function. Also, since ClickHouse doesn't have an OVER clause like SQL, I'll use a subquery with PARTITION BY.\n\nSo, the translated query should have a subquery inside COUNT for each part, and the division outside.\n\nI think I've covered all parts now, so time to write the final SQL.\n</think>\n\n{'answer': 'SELECT DISTINCT (CAST(COUNT(CASE T1.nation = \\'Sweden\\' THEN T1.ELITEID ELSE NULL END) AS Int64) * 100 / COUNT(T1.ELITEID) FROM (SELECT T1.ELITEID, T2.SEASON FROM PlayerInfo AS T1 INNER JOIN SeasonStatus AS T2 ON T1.ELITEID = T2.ELITEID WHERE T2.SEASON IN (\\'1997-1998\\', \\'1998-1999\\', \\'1999-2000\\')) subquery)')"}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 10579290250, "load_duration": 63884002, "prompt_eval_count": 739, "prompt_eval_duration": 141779030, "eval_count": 597, "eval_duration": 10367967079, "sql_id": 507}

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the original SQL query they provided. It's a SELECT statement with several joins and conditions. The main goal is to ensure that the translated query in ClickHouse is functionally equivalent.\n\nThe original query is:\n\nSELECT SUM((T1.Sales / (1 - T1.Discount)) * T1.Quantity - T1.Profit) AS cost FROM east_superstore AS T1\nINNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.`Customer ID` = T2.`Customer ID`\nINNER JOIN product AS T3 ON T1.`Product ID` = T3.`Product ID` AND T1.Region = T3.Region\nWHERE T1.Region = 'East' AND T2.`Customer Name` = 'Brad Thomas' AND strftime('%Y', T1.`Order Date`) = '2016'\n\nI notice that the joins are using aliases, which in SQL is common practice. So, I'll need to translate each table alias correctly.\n\nLooking at the schemas provided, both SQLite and ClickHouse have similar tables: east_superstore, people, and product. The column names seem to be consistent except for some data types like date handling. For example, SQLite's date is Date while ClickHouse uses Date32. But in this case, since we're using strftime on Order Date, it should still work similarly.\n\nThe main function being calculated is SUM((T1.Sales / (1 - T1.Discount)) * T1.Quantity - T1.Profit). I need to ensure that the data types for Sales, Discount, Quantity, and Profit are correctly represented in ClickHouse. From the schema, these columns are all numeric or integer types, so that should be fine.\n\nNow, about the joins: In SQLite, the join order is important, but in SQL generally, the order of joins doesn't affect the result as long as it's a Cartesian product. However, I'll need to make sure that the aliases match correctly in ClickHouse.\n\nOne thing to note is that in ClickHouse, string comparisons are case-sensitive unless specified otherwise. So, making sure that 'East' and 'Brad Thomas' are matched correctly based on case sensitivity.\n\nThe date condition uses strftime('%Y', T1.`Order Date`) = '2016'. In ClickHouse, the Date32 type supports strftime, so I can use the same function there.\n\nAnother point is the table aliases in the FROM clause. The original query uses east_superstore AS T1, people AS T2, and product AS T3. In ClickHouse, when using aliased tables in joins, it's often necessary to specify the alias in each join condition or in the subquery if using a CTE.\n\nWait, in the original SQL, the FROM clause is just 'east_superstore AS T1', but then there are two INNER JOINs. So in ClickHouse, I'll need to write the FROM clause with all three tables: east_superstore, people, and product, each aliased appropriately as T1, T2, T3.\n\nBut how should I structure this? Since it's a multi-way join, perhaps using a subquery or expanding the joins. Alternatively, in ClickHouse, when joining multiple tables, it's recommended to use aliases in the join conditions directly.\n\nLet me think: In ClickHouse, each JOIN condition can specify the alias for the columns being joined, so I don't need to alias the table names in the FROM clause unless I want to reference them by alias in other parts of the query. Since the SELECT uses T1, T2, and T3 as aliases, I should include those in the FROM clause.\n\nSo, the FROM part would be: FROM (east_superstore AS T1) INNER JOIN people AS T2 ON ... and so on.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, you can't have multiple tables in a single query unless you use a subquery or a join chain. So perhaps I need to write it as a series of joins.\n\nAlternatively, using a CTE (Common Table Expression) might help. But the original query doesn't use any CTEs, so maybe just expanding the joins is better.\n\nWait no, in ClickHouse, you can specify multiple tables in the FROM clause by either using a subquery or a join chain. However, since it's an INNER JOIN between T1 and T2, and then another INNER JOIN between T1 and T3 with additional conditions, I need to structure this correctly.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to write the FROM clause as:\n\nFROM (SELECT * FROM east_superstore) AS t1\nINNER JOIN people AS t2 ON t1.`Customer ID` = t2.`Customer ID`\nINNER JOIN product AS t3 ON t1.`Product ID` = t3.`Product ID` AND t1.Region = t3.Region\n\nBut that might not be necessary. Alternatively, I can include all tables in the FROM clause and then use aliases.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:\n\nFROM east_superstore AS T1\nINNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID\nINNER JOIN product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region)\n\nYes, that should work. The key is to correctly alias each table and ensure the join conditions are properly written.\n\nNow, regarding the function computation: SUM((Sales / (1 - Discount)) * Quantity - Profit). I need to make sure that the order of operations is correct. Since division has higher precedence than multiplication and subtraction, it should be evaluated as ((Sales / (1 - Discount)) * Quantity) - Profit.\n\nIn ClickHouse, mathematical operations follow the same operator precedence, so this part remains unchanged.\n\nThe alias for the computed sum is 'cost', which I'll keep in the SELECT clause.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the SQL query step by step:\n\n1. FROM east_superstore AS T1\n2. INNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID\n3. INNER JOIN product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region)\n4. WHERE T1.Region = 'East' AND T2.Customer_Name = 'Brad Thomas' AND strftime(T1.Order_Date, '%Y') = '2016'\n\nWait, in ClickHouse, the syntax for strftime is different. The function takes the date and a format string as arguments. So it should be strftime(date_expression, '%Y'). Since in the schema, Order Date is Date32, which can handle strftime.\n\nSo the condition becomes: AND T1.Order_Date = CAST('2016-01-01', Date32) \u2014 Wait no, because '2016' in strftime refers to the year. Alternatively, using a date with the correct format that results in 2016 when using %Y.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to cast the Order Date to a string and then apply strftime. So:\n\nstrftime(T1.Order_Date, '%Y') = '2016'\n\nYes, because if T1.Order_Date is a Date32 type, converting it with strftime('%Y') gives the four-digit year as a string.\n\nSo I'll keep that condition as is.\n\nNow, putting all this into the SQL query:\n\nSELECT SUM((T1.Sales / (1 - T1.Discount)) * T1.Quantity - T1.Profit) AS cost\nFROM east_superstore AS T1\nINNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID\nINNER JOIN product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region)\nWHERE T1.Region = 'East' AND T2.Customer_Name = 'Brad Thomas' AND strftime(T1.Order_Date, '%Y') = '2016'\n\nWait, but in the original query, it's using T1.Order Date inside a function. So I need to make sure that the column name matches exactly.\n\nIn the schema, Order Date is written as `Order Date`. So in the query, I should reference it correctly with backticks if necessary, or use double quotes, depending on ClickHouse conventions. But in ClickHouse, identifiers are case-insensitive and typically do not require quoting unless using special characters. However, since the original uses backticks, perhaps it's safer to use them as well.\n\nSo, T1.`Order Date`.\n\nBut looking at the schema provided for ClickHouse, it's written as `Order_Date`. Wait no, in the user's message, the east_superstore table has `Order Date` as a column. So in the schema, it's:\n\n('Table: `east_superstore`\\nColumns:\\n(`Row_ID`, Int64, primary key)\\n(`Order ID`, String)\\n(`Order_Date`, Date32)\\n...')\n\nWait, so in the ClickHouse schema, the column is called Order_Date without spaces. But in SQLite, it's Order Date with a space. So perhaps that's an inconsistency.\n\nWait no, looking back at the user's message:\n\nIn the sqlite schema: `east_superstore` has columns like `Order Date`, while in ClickHouse, it's `Order_Date`. Wait, no, in the provided schemas, the SQLite east_superstore has `Order Date`, but the ClickHouse schema shows 'Table: `east_superstore`\\nColumns:\\n(`Order ID`, String)\\n(`Order_Date`, Date32)'. So in ClickHouse, the column is named Order_Date without a space.\n\nBut in the original SQL query, it's T1.`Order Date`. That might cause an issue because in ClickHouse, the column is named differently. Wait, no\u2014Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nLooking back: The user provided the schema for both databases.\n\nIn SQLite:\n\nTable: `east_superstore`\nColumns:\n(`Row ID`, integer)\n(`Order ID`, text)\n(`Order Date`, date)\n...\n\nIn ClickHouse:\n\nTable: `east_superstore`\nColumns:\n(`Row_ID`, Int64, primary key)\n(`Order_ID`, String)\n(`Order_Date`, Date32)\n\nSo the column names are different: Order Date vs. Order_Date in ClickHouse.\n\nThat's a problem because the aliases used in the query (T1.Order Date) don't match the actual column name in ClickHouse.\n\nWait, that complicates things. So in the original query, T1 refers to east_superstore with columns like `Order Date`, but in ClickHouse, it's Order_Date without the space.\n\nSo, I need to adjust the aliases in the FROM clause to match the ClickHouse column names.\n\nThis means that when I alias the tables, I should use the correct column names. So perhaps the FROM clause should be:\n\nFROM east_superstore AS T1\nINNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID\nINNER JOIN product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region)\n\nBut then, in the WHERE clause, I need to refer to `Order Date` which in ClickHouse is Order_Date.\n\nWait, no. Because in ClickHouse, column names are without spaces, so the actual column name is Order_Date, not Order Date. So in the FROM clause, when I alias east_superstore as T1, T1's columns will be named as per ClickHouse schema: Row_ID, Order_ID, Order_Date, etc.\n\nTherefore, in the query, when referring to T1.Order Date, it won't match because in T1, it's Order_Date.\n\nSo to fix this, I need to alias the table with the correct column names. Alternatively, use an alias that includes the space if necessary, but ClickHouse doesn't allow spaces in column names, so probably better to stick with the actual names.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the schema? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nNo, looking back, the user provided two schemas: one for SQLite and one for ClickHouse. In SQLite, east_superstore has `Order Date` as a date column, while in ClickHouse, it's Order_Date as a Date32 column. So they're different names with spaces vs without.\n\nThat means that when translating, I have to refer to the correct column name based on the target database.\n\nSo, in the FROM clause of ClickHouse, east_superstore is aliased as T1, and its columns are Row_ID, Order_ID, Order_Date, etc. So in the query, when referring to T1.Order Date, it's incorrect because the actual column is named Order_Date without a space.\n\nTherefore, I need to adjust the column references accordingly.\n\nSo, the original query uses T1.`Order Date`, but in ClickHouse, the correct column name is Order_Date, so I should use T1.Order_Date with no backticks if it's case-insensitive, or with backticks if needed.\n\nWait, in ClickHouse, if a table has a column named `order_date`, then referencing it as T1.order_date (lowercase) would work because it's case-insensitive. So perhaps I can just use T1.Order_Date without any special syntax.\n\nAlternatively, to be safe, using backticks: T1.`Order_Date`.\n\nBut in the original query, it's using backticks for column names with spaces, like `Customer ID`, which are also present in ClickHouse as Customer_ID without space. Wait no, looking at the schema again:\n\nIn the user's message, the ClickHouse schema shows 'Columns:\\n(`Customer_ID`, String, primary key)'. So Customer_ID is a single identifier, not separated by spaces or underscores.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. In the provided schemas, it's written as `Customer ID` for SQLite and `Customer_ID` for ClickHouse. So the column name in ClickHouse is actually Customer_ID without spaces, but in the query, T2.Customer Name refers to Customer_Name.\n\nWait, no, looking back: The user's schema for people table:\n\nIn SQLite: columns include (`Customer ID`, text, primary key), `Customer Name` etc.\n\nIn ClickHouse: same as SQLite? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn the schema provided by the user:\n\nFor people in ClickHouse: 'Columns:\\n(`Customer_ID`, String, primary key)\\n(`Customer_Name`, String)\\n...'\n\nSo, in the query, T2.Customer ID is from the people table's Customer_ID column.\n\nTherefore, in the translated SQL, when referencing T1.Customer_ID and T2.Customer_ID, it's correct because they correspond to the columns without spaces or with underscores if present.\n\nWait, but in the original query, the alias is T1.Customer ID, which might be a space, but in ClickHouse, it's Customer_ID. So perhaps there's an inconsistency here.\n\nThis suggests that the user might have made a mistake in the column names between SQLite and ClickHouse. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the correct column names as per ClickHouse.\n\nIn any case, moving forward, the key is to ensure that all references to columns match the target database's schema.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- In the FROM clause: T1 refers to east_superstore, whose columns are Row_ID, Order_ID, Order_Date, etc.\n- The join conditions use Customer_ID and Product_ID, which should match correctly as they're likely without spaces in ClickHouse.\n- The Order_Date column in T1 should be used as is.\n\nTherefore, the translated SQL should reference:\n\nT1.Order_Date instead of T1.`Order Date`.\n\nSo, adjusting the original query accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together, here's the step-by-step translation:\n\n1. SELECT the desired calculation with SUM and alias it as 'cost'.\n2. FROM east_superstore AS T1 (with correct column names).\n3. INNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID.\n4. INNER JOIN product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region).\n5. WHERE:\n   - T1.Region = 'East'\n   - T2.Customer_Name = 'Brad Thomas'\n   - strftime(T1.Order_Date, '%Y') = '2016'\n\nSo the final SQL would look like:\n\nSELECT SUM((T1.Sales / (1 - T1.Discount)) * T1.Quantity - T1.Profit) AS cost\nFROM east_superstore AS T1\nINNER JOIN people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID\nINNER JOIN product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region)\nWHERE T1.Region = 'East' AND T2.Customer_Name = 'Brad Thomas' AND strftime(T1.Order_Date, '%Y') = '2016'\n\nI think that's the correct translation considering all the nuances.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the given SQL query from SQLite to ClickHouse, we need to ensure that column names and aliases match correctly between the two databases. Here's the step-by-step explanation:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Column Names and Aliases**\n\n- **SQLite Columns (east_superstore table):**\n  - `Order Date` (date type)\n  \n- **ClickHouse Columns (east_superstore table):**\n  - `Order_Date` (Date32 type)\n\n**Step 2: Translate Column References Correctly**\n\n- In the original query, `T1.Order Date` refers to the `Order Date` column in SQLite.\n- In ClickHouse, this corresponds to `T1.Order_Date`.\n\n**Step 3: Update Joins and Conditions**\n\n- Ensure that all joins and conditions use the correct column names based on ClickHouse schema.\n  \n**Final Translated SQL Query:**\n\n```sql\nSELECT \n    SUM((T1.Sales / (1 - T1.Discount)) * T1.Quantity - T1.Profit) AS cost\nFROM \n    east_superstore AS T1\nINNER JOIN \n    people AS T2 ON T1.Customer_ID = T2.Customer_ID\nINNER JOIN \n    product AS T3 ON (T1.Product_ID = T3.Product_ID AND T1.Region = T3.Region)\nWHERE \n    T1.Region = 'East' \n    AND T2.Customer_Name = 'Brad Thomas' \n    AND strftime(T1.Order_Date, '%Y') = '2016';\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **SELECT Clause:** Keeps the original calculation to compute the total profit with the specified formula and aliases the result as `cost`.\n- **FROM Clause:** References `east_superstore` as `T1`, ensuring column names match ClickHouse's schema.\n- **INNER JOINs:** Use correct table aliases (`T2` for people, `T3` for product) and join conditions based on ClickHouse column names.\n- **WHERE Clause:** Correctly references the region, customer name, and date filter using the appropriate column names and functions.\n\nThis translated query ensures that all elements from the original SQLite query are accurately reflected in ClickHouse."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 67994848040, "load_duration": 59530965, "prompt_eval_count": 638, "prompt_eval_duration": 131512031, "eval_count": 3955, "eval_duration": 67800440000, "sql_id": 197}

Let me start by analyzing the original query.\n\nThe query is:\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients AS T1 INNER JOIN conditions AS T2 ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT WHERE DESCRIPTION = 'Pneumonia' AND strftime('%Y', T1.birthdate) LIKE '192%'\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components. The main goal is to count distinct patients in the patients table who have a condition where DESCRIPTION is 'Pneumonia'. Additionally, these patients must have a birth year starting with '192%'.\n\nLooking at the schema for both databases:\n\nIn SQLite:\n- patients table has columns like patient (primary key), birthdate.\n- conditions table has columns like PATIENT (foreign key to patients), DESCRIPTION.\n\nIn ClickHouse:\n- The structure is similar but uses different column types, like Date32 for dates and Int64 for integers. Also, some column names might be in a different case, such as 'PATIENT' vs. 'patient'.\n\nNow, the original query uses an INNER JOIN between patients (T1) and conditions (T2). However, in ClickHouse, using aliases or table names with spaces isn't typical. So, I should use backticks for table names and columns that have special characters.\n\nWait, actually, in SQL, when using aliases like AS T1, it's better to avoid using the same column name across both tables. But since the join is on 'patient' from patients and 'PATIENT' from conditions, they must be compatible.\n\nI need to count distinct patients where their birthdate's year starts with 192%. So, I'll use a WHERE clause on T1.birthdate, but I have to convert it into a string to check the LIKE condition. In SQLite, strftime('%Y', birthdate) gives the four-digit year. In ClickHouse, I can use the same function, but since it's a date column, maybe I should cast it as a string.\n\nWait, in ClickHouse, functions are applied differently. For example, to get the year from a Date32 column, you can use 'year' function. But if I need the full ISO string, perhaps using format() with the appropriate format string would work.\n\nWait, actually, for the LIKE condition, maybe converting the birthdate to a string using format('%Y', ...) is better. So, in ClickHouse, it's something like T1.birthdate.toISO() or using strftime as a function.\n\nBut wait, looking at the schema, in SQLite, 'birthdate' is a date type, and in ClickHouse, it's Date32. So, to get the year as a string, I can use format('%Y', T1.birthdate) similar to SQLite.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, functions for dates might be different. Maybe using 'year' function is better. Alternatively, using a CAST or converting the date column to a string.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to cast the birthdate to a string with the ISO year format. So, something like T1.birthdate.toIso() in ClickHouse.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the exact syntax. Let me think again. The strftime function in SQLite converts a date into a string representation of the date. In ClickHouse, perhaps the equivalent is using the toIso() method or a format function.\n\nAlternatively, since birthdate is a Date32 type, maybe using the year component as an integer and then concatenating it with '%' isn't necessary because the LIKE condition expects a string. So, I can convert the year to a string and add '%' at the end.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use a CAST or CONVERT function. For example, CAST(year(T1.birthdate) AS String) + '%'.\n\nBut that might not work directly in a WHERE clause. Alternatively, using the format function: format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") would give me '1928', and then I can apply LIKE '192%'.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, the date functions are different. Let me check the documentation.\n\nIn ClickHouse, to extract the year from a Date32 column, you can use the 'year' function: year(T1.birthdate). Then, cast that integer to a String and add '%' at the end.\n\nSo, the condition becomes where year(T1.birthdate) as String starts with '192%'.\n\nWait, but in SQL, when using LIKE, it's better to have the string on one side. So, perhaps I can use something like CAST(year(T1.birthdate) AS String) + '%' || 'anything', but maybe a more straightforward way is to cast the entire birthdate to a string with the year and then apply LIKE.\n\nAlternatively, since in SQLite we used strftime('%Y', T1.birthdate) LIKE '192%', perhaps in ClickHouse, using format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") would be similar.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, the Date32 type has methods like toIso(), which returns a string in ISO 8601 format. So, maybe I can use that.\n\nSo, T1.birthdate.toIso() would return something like '2023-10-31', and then I can extract the year part from there. But for the LIKE condition, perhaps it's better to just check if the year starts with '192%'.\n\nAlternatively, I can cast the birthdate to a String and then use substring or a regex to check the start of the string.\n\nHmm, but using LIKE might not be sufficient for that because the date could have hyphens or other separators. So perhaps it's better to process the year separately.\n\nWait, maybe I should change the approach: instead of using strftime in the WHERE clause, I can precompute a condition on the birthdate. For example, create a column that checks if the birthdate is in a specific range that starts with '192%'.\n\nBut that might complicate things. Alternatively, in the WHERE clause, cast the year to a String and check if it starts with '192%'.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients AS T1\nINNER JOIN conditions AS T2 ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT\nWHERE T2.DESCRIPTION = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, I need to make sure that the birthdate is correctly formatted. Alternatively, using year(T1.birthdate) as a String and then check if it starts with '192'.\n\nBut how do I handle that in SQL? Maybe:\n\nWHERE CAST(year(T1.birthdate), String) LIKE '192%'\n\nWait, but in SQL, you can't directly cast a function to a string. So perhaps:\n\nWHERE year(T1.birthdate) as String(10) LIKE '192%'\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to create a calculated column that converts the year to a String and then applies the LIKE condition.\n\nBut maybe a more straightforward way is to use the format function with \"%Y\" and then apply LIKE.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, using format on a Date32 column would give me the date as a string in ISO format. So, '2023-10-31' for example.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to extract just the year part. Maybe:\n\nWHERE substr(format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\"), 0, 4) LIKE '192%'\n\nWait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe use a regex in ClickHouse.\n\nBut since the original query uses LIKE, which is similar to SQL regex, perhaps I can make it work with substr.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to handle this by converting the birthdate to a String and then using a function to check if it starts with '192%'.\n\nWait, maybe the best approach is:\n\nWHERE format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nBecause that directly translates the SQLite condition. Let me test this in my mind.\n\nIn SQLite, strftime('%Y', T1.birthdate) gives the four-digit year as a string. So if birthdate is 1928-01-01, it returns '1928'. Then, the LIKE '192%' would match because it starts with '192'.\n\nWait, no, '1928' does not start with '192%', but maybe in the original query, it's intended to match any patient born in a year that is 1920 or later (since '192%' implies starting with 192). But the exact logic depends on how the original SQL is written.\n\nBut regardless, the approach is to take the birthdate, format it as a string representing the full ISO year, and then check if that string starts with '192'.\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, using format with \"%Y\" would give me \"YYYY-MM-DD\", so for 1928-01-01, it's \"1928-01-01\". So, the LIKE '192%' would not match because it's expecting the entire string to start with '192', which it does, but then there's a hyphen and more digits.\n\nWait, no. The LIKE clause in SQL compares the pattern against the entire string unless you specify otherwise. So, for example, if the formatted date is \"1928-01-01\", then \"192%\" would match because it starts with \"192\".\n\nBut wait, \"1928\" starts with \"192\", but \"192%\" as a pattern would require two more characters after '2', making it \"192X\" where X is any character. So, \"1928\" does satisfy that.\n\nWait, no. The LIKE condition is exact in the sense that if you have '192%' and the string starts with '192', then it's a match. For example, '1928' matches '192%', because the first three characters are '192', but the fourth character is '8', which is part of '192%'. Wait, no, because '192%' as a pattern would require the first four characters to be '192X', where X is any single character. So, '1928' does satisfy that.\n\nWait, let's clarify: in SQL, \"LIKE\" uses the same syntax as regular expressions for the pattern matching, but without using any regex syntax like '*', '?', etc., except for the '%' which matches any number of characters (but not escaped). So, if I have '192%', it means:\n\n- The first character is '1'\n- Second: '9'\n- Third: '2'\n- Then, any number of characters (including zero), because the fourth position is '%', but in reality, the pattern ends there.\n\nWait, no. In SQL, when using LIKE, '%' in the pattern matches exactly one character unless it's escaped or used as a special modifier, which it isn't here. So, '192%' would match any string that has exactly those four characters: '1','9','2','%'. But wait, no, because % is not a valid character in a LIKE pattern unless it's escaped.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing things. Let me check the SQL syntax for LIKE.\n\nIn SQL, the LIKE operator compares patterns where '%' matches any number of characters (including zero). So, if you have a string '1928-01-01' and the pattern is '192%', it would match because the first four characters are '192', but then there's an '-' which is not part of the pattern. Wait, no: the entire string must start with the pattern. So, for example:\n\n'1928-01-01' starts with '192', but the LIKE '192%' requires that after '192', there is at least one more character (because '%' in LIKE matches any single character, not as a wildcard). Wait, no: in SQL, the '%' in LIKE is a literal '%', unless it's escaped. So, if I have:\n\nWHERE format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nThen, it would match any string that starts with '192' followed by a single '%'. But in reality, birthdates don't include '%' as part of the year.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe the original query intended to check if the birth year starts with 192, so any patient born from 1920 onwards. So, maybe the condition should be where the birthdate is >= '1920-01-01' and <= '1999-12-31'.\n\nBut that would require a different approach, possibly using BETWEEN or other date functions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original condition was meant to find patients born in any year starting with 192 (i.e., 1920 onwards), but expressed as '192%' in the LIKE clause. But in reality, it's better to use date ranges for such conditions.\n\nWait, but since the task is to translate the query functionally equivalently, perhaps I should replicate exactly what the original did, even if it's not the most efficient.\n\nSo, back to the condition: in SQLite, it uses strftime('%Y', T1.birthdate) LIKE '192%'. So, let's see how that works. The output of strftime('%Y', ...) is a four-digit year as a string. Then, '192%' would match any four-character strings starting with '192' followed by any character.\n\nWait, but '1928' is four characters and starts with '192', so it matches '192%'. That doesn't make sense because '%' isn't part of the birthdate. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original condition was meant to check if the year is >= 1920, which would be better expressed as a range.\n\nBut regardless, I need to translate the condition exactly as it is.\n\nSo, in ClickHouse, since we can't use strftime directly on a Date32 column as a string, perhaps using format or another function.\n\nWait, in ClickHouse, you can cast a Date32 column to String. So, T1.birthdate as String would give me something like 'YYYY-MM-DD', but that's not helpful for the year only.\n\nAlternatively, use the year() function: year(T1.birthdate) returns an Int64 (the four-digit year). Then, I can cast it to a String and check if it starts with '192'.\n\nBut how do I check if a number starts with '192' in SQL? One way is to convert the number to a string and then use LIKE or a similar function.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nWHERE CAST(year(T1.birthdate) AS String) LIKE '192%'\n\nWait, but in SQL, you can't directly cast a column's value. So, I need to cast the entire expression as a String.\n\nAlternatively, use a function that returns a String representation of the year and then check if it starts with '192'.\n\nAnother approach is to use a regex in ClickHouse.\n\nBut since the task is to translate the query as is, perhaps the best way is to adjust the condition to match the functionality.\n\nWait, maybe using the format function with \"%Y\" and then substring to get the first four characters.\n\nSo:\n\nWHERE substr(format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\"), 0,4) LIKE '192%'\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best way. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a date range.\n\nWait, but the original query uses strftime and LIKE, so maybe we can replicate that in ClickHouse by converting the birthdate to a string using format and then applying LIKE.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients AS T1\nINNER JOIN conditions AS T2 ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT\nWHERE T2.DESCRIPTION = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nWait, but in ClickHouse, does format work with Date32 columns? Let me check.\n\nYes, in ClickHouse, the format function can be used on date columns. So, format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") would give the four-digit year as a String.\n\nSo, that should work.\n\nNow, regarding aliases: in SQLite, you can alias tables as T1 and T2, but in ClickHouse, it's more common to use backticks or other naming conventions without aliases. So, perhaps it's better to specify the table names with their columns.\n\nWait, actually, when using INNER JOIN, we need to ensure that the columns match correctly. In SQLite, 'patient' in patients and 'PATIENT' in conditions are both text type. In ClickHouse, they might be case-sensitive, so maybe 'patient' vs. 'PATIENT' could cause issues if not handled properly.\n\nWait, but in the schema provided for ClickHouse, the columns are 'PATIENT', which is capitalized. So, perhaps in the original query, T1.patient and T2.PATIENT need to be matched correctly.\n\nIn SQLite, column names are case-insensitive, so that's why it works as is. In ClickHouse, identifiers are case-sensitive by default, so 'patient' in one table and 'PATIENT' in another might cause issues unless they're properly aliased or quoted.\n\nBut since we can't change the schema, perhaps we need to adjust the query accordingly.\n\nWait, but in the original query, the inner join is on T1.patient = T2.PATIENT. In SQLite, this works because column names are case-insensitive. But in ClickHouse, if one table's column is 'patient' and another is 'PATIENT', they are considered different columns unless quoted.\n\nSo, to make it work, we need to refer to them correctly.\n\nBut since the task is to translate the SQL query, perhaps I should adjust the aliases or use quoting.\n\nAlternatively, in ClickHouse, you can alias the tables with AS clauses. But the syntax might be different.\n\nWait, no. In ClickHouse, when using joins, you specify the columns explicitly without using aliases for tables. So, if the columns are 'patient' and 'PATIENT', perhaps they need to be case-insensitive or quoted.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the schema names, maybe I should adjust the join condition by quoting both column names to ensure case-insensitivity.\n\nIn SQL, you can do that with double quotes. So, in ClickHouse, if I write:\n\nT1.\"patient\" = T2.\"PATIENT\"\n\nThat would make it case-insensitive because of the quotes.\n\nBut wait, in ClickHouse, single quotes are used for string literals, while double quotes can be used to enclose identifiers, making them case-sensitive. So, perhaps using double quotes around both columns will ensure that the comparison is done correctly regardless of case.\n\nAlternatively, if the column names are stored in a case-insensitive manner, but I think in ClickHouse they're case-sensitive by default unless quoted.\n\nSo, to make sure that T1.patient and T2.PATIENT match, perhaps we need to use double quotes around them.\n\nBut since the original query doesn't have any quotes, perhaps in the translated version, it's necessary to include them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can adjust the column names to be case-insensitive by using a case-insensitive join condition.\n\nBut that might complicate things.\n\nWait, another approach is to CAST both columns to uppercase or lowercase and then compare.\n\nSo:\n\nT1.patient as String = T2.PATIENT as String\n\nBut perhaps better to cast them as strings and compare in a case-sensitive manner.\n\nAlternatively, use the toUpper() function in ClickHouse if available.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's safer to quote both column names.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients T1\nINNER JOIN conditions T2 ON T1.\"patient\" = T2.\"PATIENT\"\nWHERE T2.DESCRIPTION = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nBut in ClickHouse, the syntax for joins requires explicit column names. So, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 'patient' from patients) FROM ... ?\n\nNo, that's not right.\n\nWait, no. The correct approach is to specify the tables and their columns in the ON clause.\n\nSo, it should be:\n\nINNER JOIN T2.conditions ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT\n\nBut since column names are case-sensitive, perhaps quoting them as T1.\"patient\" = T2.\"PATIENT\"\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the tables have the columns in the same case, but the schema provided has 'patient' and 'PATIENT', so unless they're the same, it won't match.\n\nThis could be a potential issue, but since the task is to translate the query as is, I'll proceed under the assumption that the column names can be matched correctly without further changes.\n\nSo, the final translated query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients T1\nINNER JOIN conditions T2 ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT\nWHERE T2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nBut I need to make sure that the case of the column names matches in ClickHouse. If not, then we might need to adjust them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to write:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients as t1\nINNER JOIN conditions as t2 ON t1.patient = t2.PATIENT\nWHERE t2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(t1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nBut I'm not sure if the AS aliases are necessary or how they're used in ClickHouse.\n\nWait, perhaps in ClickHouse, when using joins, you have to specify the columns explicitly. So, it's better to write:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients\nINNER JOIN conditions ON T1.patient = T2.PATIENT\nWHERE T2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nBut again, the issue is with the column names. If in ClickHouse, the columns are stored as 'patient' and 'PATIENT', they won't match unless treated case-insensitively.\n\nSo, perhaps to make it safe, I should use double quotes around both column names:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.\"patient\") FROM patients\nINNER JOIN conditions ON T2.\"PATIENT\" = T1.\"patient\"\nWHERE T2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%'\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps in ClickHouse, using single quotes for string literals and double quotes for identifiers.\n\nWait, actually, in SQL-like dialects supported by ClickHouse, you can use double quotes to enclose identifiers, which makes them case-sensitive.\n\nSo, to ensure that the join works correctly between 'patient' and 'PATIENT', I need to refer to both with their exact cases unless I quote them.\n\nBut since I don't know how the actual tables are named, perhaps it's safer to use single quotes if possible.\n\nWait, no. Single quotes in SQL are used for string literals, not for identifiers. So, to refer to an identifier named 'patient', you need to enclose it in double quotes: \"patient\".\n\nSo, in the join condition:\n\nT1.\"patient\" = T2.\"PATIENT\"\n\nThis way, both columns are treated as case-sensitive.\n\nBut in the original query, there were no quotes, so perhaps that's unnecessary. But given that the column names might be different in case, it's better to include them.\n\nAlternatively, if the column names can't be changed, perhaps I should adjust the join condition by casting the columns to a common type or using functions to make them case-insensitive.\n\nBut this complicates things beyond the scope of the task. So, for the purpose of this translation, I'll proceed with including the quotes to handle case sensitivity.\n\nTherefore, the final translated query would be:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.\"patient\") FROM patients AS t1\nINNER JOIN conditions AS t2 ON t1.\"patient\" = t2.\"PATIENT\"\nWHERE t2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(t1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%';\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure about the syntax. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to omit the aliases and just use:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.patient) FROM patients\nINNER JOIN conditions ON T1.\"patient\" = T2.\"PATIENT\"\nWHERE T2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%';\n\nBut in practice, I might need to adjust based on how ClickHouse handles column names.\n\nAnother point is that in SQLite, the COUNT(DISTINCT) function can sometimes be tricky because it's not a SQL standard. But ClickHouse supports it, so that part should be fine.\n\nSo, putting all together, the final query would look like this.\n</think>\n\nTo translate the given SQL query from SQLite to ClickHouse while maintaining its functionality, we need to ensure that column names are handled correctly and date formatting is accurately replicated. Here's the step-by-step translation:\n\n1. **Column Aliases**: Use double quotes around column names to handle case sensitivity in ClickHouse since it treats identifiers as case-sensitive by default.\n2. **Date Formatting**: Replace `strftime` with `format` function and ensure that the year is formatted correctly using `%Y`.\n3. **String Comparison**: Maintain the string comparison using `LIKE` and adjust for any necessary quoting.\n\nThe translated SQL query in ClickHouse is:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.\"patient\") FROM patients\nINNER JOIN conditions ON T1.\"patient\" = T2.\"PATIENT\"\nWHERE T2.description = 'Pneumonia'\nAND format(T1.birthdate, \"%Y\") LIKE '192%';\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **COUNT(DISTINCT `T1.patient`)**: Ensures we count each unique patient once.\n- **INNER JOIN**: Joins the `patients` table (`T1`) with the `conditions` table (`T2`) on the `patient` column, using case-sensitive matching by quoting column names.\n- **WHERE Clause**: Filters patients where the `description` field is 'Pneumonia'.\n- **AND Clause**: Filters patients whose birthdate's formatted year starts with '192' (i.e., years from 1920 onwards).\n\nThis query ensures that all original conditions are met while adapting to ClickHouse's specific syntax and data handling requirements."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 98665509986, "load_duration": 66242509, "prompt_eval_count": 504, "prompt_eval_duration": 31632724, "eval_count": 5542, "eval_duration": 98564308795, "sql_id": 107}
