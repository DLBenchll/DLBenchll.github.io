The datatype of the `event_id` column in the SQLite schema is defined as an integer, while in the MySQL schema it is defined as a BIGINT. Therefore, we need to modify the datatype of the `event_id` column in the SQLite schema to match that of the MySQL schema.\n2. The datatype of the `device_id`, `timestamp`, `longitude`, and `latitude` columns in the SQLite schema are defined as real numbers, while in the MySQL schema they are defined as DOUBLE precision floating-point numbers. Therefore, we need to modify the datatype of these columns in the SQLite schema to match that of the MySQL schema.\n3. The SQLite statement uses the `IIF` function to calculate the difference between two SUM statements. However, the MySQL database does not support the `IIF` function, so we replace it with the `IF` function instead.\n4. The SQLite statement also uses the `-` operator to subtract the result of the two SUM statements from each other.

Therefore, we need to use the `>=` and `<=` operators instead of `BETWEEN` in MySQL.\n* In SQLite, the `NULL` value is treated as a null value. In MySQL, the `NULL` value is treated as an empty string (e.g., the string \"\"). Therefore, we need to use the `IS NULL` operator instead of `=` when comparing the result of a case expression with `NULL`.\n* In SQLite, the `DATEDIFF` function returns the difference between two dates in days. In MySQL, the `TIMESTAMPDIFF` function returns the difference between two dates in units specified by the second argument (e.g., `TIMESTAMPDIFF(year, start_date, end_date)`).

In SQLite, the `strftime` function is used to extract the year from a date field. In MySQL, the `YEAR` function can be used instead.\n2. The data type for `stars`, `votes`, and `percent` in the Vote table is integer in SQLite but double in MySQL. Therefore, the query uses `BIGINT` instead of `integer` to match the data type in MySQL.\n3. In MySQL, the primary key column for the Vote table is automatically created as an auto-incrementing value. In SQLite, the primary key must be explicitly defined as a rowid. Therefore, the query includes the definition for the `rowid` column in the Vote table.\n4.

For example, in the SQLite query, the `weight_id` column is defined as an integer primary key, but in MySQL it should be a BIGINT (since it is a primary key). Similarly, for the `birthdate` column, we have to use a TEXT data type in MySQL since it contains date values.\n* In SQLite, the `strftime()` function is used to extract the year from a date value. However, in MySQL, this function is not available by default. Instead, we can use the `YEAR()` function to achieve the same result. Therefore, we have to replace `strftime('%Y', T2.birthdate)` with `YEAR(T2.birthdate)` in the MySQL query.\n\nOverall, the translated MySQL query is functionally equivalent to the original SQLite query, but it uses different data types and functions for some columns due to differences between the two databases."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 30464618100, "load_duration": 6241846, "prompt_eval_count": 653, "prompt_eval_duration": 4897682291, "eval_count": 359, "eval_duration": 25557271768, "sql_id": 506}

The data types in the SQLite schema are converted to their equivalent data types in the MySQL schema, as specified by the schema information provided. For example, the `business_id` column in the `violations` table is changed from an integer to a BIGINT in MySQL, and the `date` column is changed from a date to a DATE in MySQL.\n2. The join conditions are updated to reflect the differences in data types between the SQLite and MySQL schemas. In particular, the join condition for the `violations` table is changed from `T1.business_id = T2.business_id` to `T1.business_id = CAST(T2.business_id AS BIGINT)` in order to ensure that the join works correctly with the BIGINT data type in MySQL.\n3. The where clause is updated to reflect the differences in data types between the SQLite and MySQL schemas. In particular, the `STRFTIME` function is replaced by the equivalent MySQL function `YEAR(T1.`date`) = '2015'` in order to ensure that the query works correctly with the DATE data type in MySQL.\n4. The result of the query is then counted using the `COUNT` function, which counts the number of non-null values in the specified column or expression. In this case, the count is performed on the `DISTINCT` business_id column from the joined tables, which results in a unique count of businesses that have violations and inspections in 2015 with a score greater than 90 and a postal code of '94102'."}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 51769903027, "load_duration": 5322463, "prompt_eval_count": 747, "prompt_eval_duration": 5770045197, "eval_count": 494, "eval_duration": 45992301550, "sql_id": 602}

In MySQL, this can be achieved using the `PARTITION BY` syntax.\n* In SQLite, the `date` column is selected as an integer. In MySQL, it's best to select it as a date data type instead.\n* In SQLite, the `group by` clause is specified using a subquery. In MySQL, this can be achieved using the `GROUP BY` syntax.\n* In SQLite, the `having` clause is used to filter rows based on a condition.

We also need to specify the delimiter as an argument to the function.\n3. The `INSTR` function in SQLite returns the position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string. In MySQL, we use the `LOCATE` function instead, which returns the starting position of the first occurrence of a substring within a string.\n4. The `mean_temperature_f` column is of type `BIGINT` in MySQL, while it is of type `TEXT` in SQLite. Therefore, we need to cast the value to an integer before comparing it with 62.\n5. The `subscription_type`, `start_station_name`, and `end_station_name` columns are of type `TEXT` in MySQL, while they are of type `INTEGER` in SQLite. Therefore, we need to cast the values to text before comparing them with 'Customer'.\n6. The `duration` column is of type `BIGINT` in MySQL, while it is of type `INTEGER` in SQLite. Therefore, we need to cast the value to a bigint before comparing it with 386.\n7.
