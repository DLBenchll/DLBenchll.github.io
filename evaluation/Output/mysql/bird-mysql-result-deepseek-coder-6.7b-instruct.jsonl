For example, MySQL uses `IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)` instead of `IIF()`. It also uses ANSI join syntax and implicit join syntax interchangeably. Lastly, data types are also slightly different between SQLite and MySQL for the same datatypes (e.g., INTEGER in SQLite is BIGINT in MySQL).\n"}, "done_reason": "stop", "done": true, "total_duration": 20805735627, "load_duration": 8992429, "prompt_eval_count": 409, "prompt_eval_duration": 2991644890, "eval_count": 218, "eval_duration": 17803108913, "sql_id": 371}
